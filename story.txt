There once was a man with a jubilant giggle. It was so profound, it made everyone wiggle. All the townspeople of Yorkshireshear would hear the man's giggle, year after year. The people grew restless, but he did not tire. They found him more blaring than the old town's crier. His laugh was so tough; it was so contagious. The people had enough, they found it outrageous!

One year the town's people did not hear the mans giggle no more. At first they were relieved, no more giggling at strange times of the day, no more giggling at boring normal day things. But then their town seemed to loose of it sparkle. Day by day the town turned more gray and dull. Without a contagious giggle, the people found no reason to giggle at all.

The townspeople grew to miss the man with the jubilant giggle. They needed to give him a reason to wiggle. The town got together and invited friends. They had so much fun, they soon all began to giggle! The man had shown them the importance of giggle.

Finally, the family had to buy Max the best cat food, Max only opened the door for them, but at this time the family also had a special idea - trying to get Max out of the door and let it back to its original family .

With all the good catfood and giggles to hear, the jubilant giggler returned to Yorkshireshear!
