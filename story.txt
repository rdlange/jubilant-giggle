There once was a man with a jubilant giggle. It was so profound, it made everyone wiggle. All the townspeople of Yorkshireshear would hear the man's giggle, year after year. The people grew restless, but he did not tire. They found him more blaring than the old town's crier. His laugh was so tough; it was so contagious. The people had enough, they found it outrageous!
